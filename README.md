# DataFusion Optimal Plans

This repo explores how to optimize query plans in DataFusion, starting with foundational concepts. It covers:

- Using the CLI to create tables, define schema/sort order, insert data, and run queries
- Inspecting query plans via CLI
- Writing tests and building custom logical plans
- Tuning for parallel execution
- Building and running distributed plans

Start with the docs folderâ€”each .md file introduces a focused topic, showing how to run queries in datafusion-cli or linking to test files for scenarios not supported via CLI.
